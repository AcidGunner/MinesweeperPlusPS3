# About the Port
AI-generated code is only included as a base Minesweeper mechanics. Nothing else is AI-generated, so don't worry.\
The PS3 Port includes several cool features, as remastered OST (OSTs are toggleable, so you can enjoy the original masterpiece), more hats and (upcoming) Local Versus mode.\
As for now, you can change hats by pressing L2/R2, because the proper ui is not done yet..\

> [!NOTE]
> * This port's engine is not the same, as the original's engine (Godot), so many features might be slightly different.
> * This port is in early development stage, so many bugs and incomplete features may occur. Please wait patiently. ^_^

# Some news for OG Game and PS3 Port
The Minesweeper Plus (NOT PS3 PORT) Episode 3 is delayed again. I don't know if I can say the issue, so I'm not gonna say why. We all understand the issue and we just need to wait.\
The Minesweeper Plus PS3 Port v0.3 is frozen due to being completely burnt out from developing this port.\
\
Thanks for understanding.
