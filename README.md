# About the Port
This is the fun to make. The game indeed has an AI-generated code. (only on the main minesweeper mechanics, the bosses and other stuff are proudly AI-free.)

I have a little hyper fixation on that game cuz the game itself is cool, and the smiley is cool :) 
You can change hats by pressing L2/R2, because the proper ui is not done yet..

Please wait patiently. ^_^
