# Minesweeper Plus PS3 Port
The Minesweeper Plus PS3 port is Finally open-sourced!

# Project Status
IN DEVELOP: v0.2

LATEST: v0.1.1


# About the Port
This is the fun to make. The game indeed has an AI-generated code. :P
I have a little hyper fixation on that game cuz the game itself is cool, and the smiley is cool :)
The demo version only contains first four levels.
The latest game has full Episode 1. You can change hats by pressing L2/R2, because the proper ui is not done yet..

Please wait patiently. ^_^

You can either download [Demo version](https://github.com/AcidGunner/AcidPS3Data/raw/refs/heads/main/games/minesweeperplusdemo.pkg?download=), or [latest version](https://github.com/AcidGunner/MinesweeperPlusPS3/releases/latest).

# Spoilers alert!
If you are interested of how the game is developing, you can see it's source code before the release ov the version.
